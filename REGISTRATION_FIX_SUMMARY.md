# Registration Validation Fix Summary

## 🚨 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. **Password Validation Too Strict**
**Problem**: Password validation required uppercase, lowercase, and numbers which was too restrictive.

**Before**: 
```javascript
.matches(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/)
.withMessage('Password must contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number')
```

**After**: 
```javascript
// Only requires minimum 6 characters
.isLength({ min: 6 })
.withMessage('Password must be at least 6 characters long')
```

### 2. **Missing Required Fields**
**Problem**: Backend expected `address` and `emergencyContact` fields but frontend form didn't have them.

**Added to Frontend**:
- **Address** field (textarea, required, 10-500 characters)
- **Emergency Contact** field (10-digit phone number, required)

**Added to Backend Validation**:
- `address` validation (required, 10-500 characters)
- `emergencyContact` validation (required, 10-digit number)
